## Replication Instructions: How to run A Cocinar 
*IMPORTANT: Unfortunately this tutorial will only show how to run this tutorial on windows machines because testing on the Unity app isn’t directly supported on MacOS. To work on MacOS you would have to build the project everytime you want to test it.*

Step 1: Install Unity, make sure it is the Unity version 2021.3.9.f1

Step 2: In the Unity installs section, for the install you have, make sure to download the Android Build and Windows build support as well. 

Step 3: Download the [Oculus Developer](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-win/) Hub to make sure you can use your headset as a developer. 

Step 4: Plug in your headset and make sure it is in [link mode](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-enable-device/).

Step 5: Open Unity project, hit the play button at the top and try out a simple VR Unity project.

*IMPORTANT: You need to have your headset in link mode before you open A Cocinar, this is because otherwise when you play the game, it won’t load it on your headset.*
